Welcome to the GitHub Repository of the website `Zenfit`. Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` in a virtual environment and then run the command `flask run` to activate the website. Please note that the website will not work on an empty SQL database.

It is hosted [here](http://10.17.51.178:5000) on the IITD internal network.
Please feel free to try it out.

Cheers!
